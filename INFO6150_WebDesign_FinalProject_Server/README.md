HuskyFit is a one-stop, all-inclusive solution for fitness tracking. This web application allows users to keep a record of their daily health indulgences ranging from food, water, exercise, sleep, active activities etc. And observe progress over time.

This application will be developed with a responsive UI styled using SASS which uses ReactJS that is supported by a scalable NodeJS backend that uses the ExpressJS middleware to route its requests to appropriate business logic functions. User input as well as the information displayed on the application’s various pages are recorded using MongoDB. The app also uses several open-source APIs to support additional features such as weather, events, sharing, etc.
